- Reset will clear all data (including LocalStorage).
- Used LocalStorage.
- Create Cards - act as toggle(will change if required).
- Total is just to keep a track of count.

On initial load, page should contain a form with only one Custom input row component and an
Add Row and Create Cards button.
The Custom input row component should contain two input boxes and a remove button as
shown in the above picture which will remove the component.
Add Row button should be there at the bottom of the form, when user clicks on it a custom input
box component which is mentioned above should get added into the form.
When the user clicks on the Create Card button a card should be created as shown in the above
diagram with the mentioned details.

- Name – From the input box having placeholder as Name.
- Value – From the input box having placeholder as Value.
- Id - A 8 digit random number.

On the next page a linear chart should be created with some dummy data
